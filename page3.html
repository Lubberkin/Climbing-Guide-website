        <p>
          Since bouldering requires less space, there are more bouldering gyms
          then sport climbing ones. I have mentioned 3 big gyms which have both
          <a href="page2.html">here</a>. But here I want to focus on the local
          bouldering only gyms in Prague. Because in my opinion they are nicer,
          less busy and smaller, which makes them more cozy. Here are my top 4
          bouldering gyms in Prague:

        <h3 id="ultraant">Ultraant</h3>
        <p>
          Ultraant a.k.a. Tynska is probably my favorite gym. It's a small local
          gym in the center of Prague built a long time ago in a cellar. It's
          been recently renovated and the owners and staff there is very nice.
          You can tell, that they are also climbers, which is probably why the gym is
          so good. Classic style of setting (colored papers). Only downside is
          it's size is a bit annoying during peak hours, because there isn't
          much space. The opening hours are pretty short so check before going.
          Bar and showers available. Cards <span class="red">not</span>
          accepted, so make sure you have cash.

          metro station)

        <h4 class="header2">Lokalblok</h4>
        <p>
          Very similair to Ultraant in most things, but it's slightly larger.
          Built above a good restaurant of the same name. Showers available.
          Cards <span class="red">not</span> accepted, so make sure you have
          cash.

        <h5 class="header2">BoulderBar</h5>
        <p>
          Small gym with interesting boulder and profiles. The highlight is
          definetly that there's a moonboard here. Bar and showers available.
          The staff is usually quite cranky and the opening times are quite odd.
          Check before going.

        <h6 class="header2">Hudy Karlin</h6>
        <p>
          Hudy is a brand new bouldering gym. Bouldering there is good, but
          right now the holds are pretty new so skin goes away quickly. It's
          also quite expensive and is the only gym with the price going higher
          the longer you stay there (first 3 hours no change, after that you pay
          per extra hour). They also have a weird way of rating boulders: Each
          color is a different range of difficulity, which basically means that
          one difficulity is limited to one set of holds.(only other place that
          has this is SmichOFF). Bar and showers available.
