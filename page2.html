        <p>
          There is quite a lot of sport climbing in Prague. All of the following
          recommendations are large gyms, with both bouldering and sport
          climbing availabe, but here I focus mainly on the sport climbing part.
          for bouldering recommendations click <a href="page3.html">here</a>.
          Here are my top 4 favorite sport climbing gyms:.

        <h3 class="header2">BigWall</h3>
        <p>
          BigWall is a gym that focuses mainly on sport climbing, although there
          is a small boulder area I do not recommend going there for bouldering
          only. Longest routes in Prague, at least 50m rope required. There is
          also a bar with some food and drinks. Showers available.

          Location: Ocelářská 891/16, 190 00 Praha 9 (couple parking spaces
          availabe, close to Ceskomoravska metro station)

        <h4 class="header2">SmichOFF</h4>
        <p>
          Smichoff is probably the most popular gym in Prague and it's good for
          beginners. Which means it's often very full. I recommend going there
          only outside of peak hours. Otherwise you might have to wait in line,
          and wil overall have a poor experience. Sport climbing isn't bad
          there, there are a lot of different profiles available (large boulder
          area as well). 40m rope will suffice. Bar with food and drinks
          available. Showers available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Location: Křížová 6, 150 00 Praha 5-Smíchov (big parking lot, near
          Smichovske Nadrazi metro station)

        <h5 class="header2">Trinactka (13)</h5>
        <p>
          Further away from the center compared to other gyms, but has both
          sport climbing and boulder. Sport climbing area is smaller than
          Smichoff's for example but it's still good. 40m rope will suffice.
          Part of a bigger sport complex, which includes a restaurant as well.
          Large parking area. Can get quite busy lately but opening hours are
          quite good. Using their website you can charge money onto a card, so
          you don't need to wait in line. Best bouldering out of the 3 options.
          Two stories of boulders on interesting profiles. Showers available.

          Location: Jeremiášova 2581/2, 155 00 Praha 13-Stodůlky (big parking
          lot, between Luka and Luziny metro stations)

        <h6 class="header2">Jungle Letnany</h6>
        <p>
          This is a pretty new gym and it's really big. It has both bouldering
          and sport climbing The sport routes are pretty short compared to other
          gyms, but they are very nice and there's a lot of interesting
          profiles. There is also a wall with competition boulders, which are
          very difficult, but fun to try. In the future there will also be a
          kilterboard. 40m rope is enough. Restaurant available. Showers
          available.
